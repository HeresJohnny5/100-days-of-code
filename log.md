# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Over the next 100 days I want to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript, I want to better understand Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, and I want to update my portfolio. 

### Day 1: January 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working through some algorithms, I completed challenges including, but not limited to: **reversestring, reverseint, palindrome, maxchar, and fizzbuzz.** [GitHub: newAlgorithms](https://github.com/HeresJohnny5/newAlgorithms).

I also worked on the 2nd week of MongoDB University's **M001: MongoDB Basics** learning more about *Compass and query operations*.

**Thoughts:** Although working on algorithms can be very frustrating at times, I enjoy the challenge and appreciate being able to complete something with a days work. When working through the algorithms I chose to use ES6 syntax, which forced me to spend some time on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). 

As far as MongoDB is concerned, let's just say I have much to learn. I learned more about querying data using methods **.find, .insertOne(), and .insertMany()**.  

### Day 2: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrapped up week 2 of MongoDB University's M001: Introduction to MongoDB Basics. I spent a good chunk of time on MongoDB's documentation reinforcing what I'm learning about Update Operators. 

I also took some time to better understand how an ES6 Array Helper Method, *reduce* can help me solve a **maxchar algorithm**, providing a much better, less convoluted solution.

**Thoughts**: Having access to resources makes it quite easy to ask for premature assistance, however it's extremely important that one learns to struggle before reaching out for help. I spent a good amount of time debugging code using the Google Developer Tools when working through the maxchar algorithm and in doing such I now better understand how to use reduce.
