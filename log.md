# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Over the next 100 days I want to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript, I want to better understand Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, and I want to update my portfolio. 

### Day 1: January 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working through some algorithms, I completed challenges including, but not limited to: **reversestring, reverseint, palindrome, maxchar, and fizzbuzz.** [GitHub: jsAlgorithms](https://github.com/HeresJohnny5/jsAlgorithms).

I also worked on the 2nd week of MongoDB University's **M001: MongoDB Basics** learning more about *Compass and query operations*.

**Thoughts:** Although working on algorithms can be very frustrating at times, I enjoy the challenge and appreciate being able to complete something with a days work. When working through the algorithms I chose to use ES6 syntax, which forced me to spend some time on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). 

As far as MongoDB is concerned, let's just say I have much to learn. I learned more about querying data using methods **.find, .insertOne(), and .insertMany()**.  

### Day 2: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrapped up week 2 of MongoDB University's M001: Introduction to MongoDB Basics. I spent a good chunk of time on MongoDB's documentation reinforcing what I'm learning about Update Operators. 

I also took some time to better understand how an ES6 Array Helper Method, *reduce* can help me solve a **maxchar algorithm**, providing a much better, less convoluted solution.

**Thoughts**: Having access to resources makes it quite easy to ask for premature assistance, however it's extremely important that one learns to struggle before reaching out for help. I spent a good amount of time debugging code using the Google Developer Tools when working through the maxchar algorithm and in doing such I now better understand how to use reduce.

### Day 3: January 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: While I wasn't able to accomplish as much as I'd hope to, I completed yet another algorithm challenge, let alone deploy my weather application. 

**Thoughts**: Using the *slice* method I didn't have much difficulty completing the chunk algorithm challenge, however what I didn't realize is the *slice* method destroys the array which calls the method in the first place. This forced me to do some research and better yet consider alternative options. The more I learn about *reduce* the more I'm falling in love with this amazing Array Helper Method. I also was able to deploy my [Web App](https://nameless-bastion-76427.herokuapp.com/index). 

### Day 4: January 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to complete two algorithm challenges, **anagrams** and **capitalize** using multiple solutions. I also spent some time building a very basic express app, not so much to build, but to better understand the magic behind boilerplate code.

**Thoughts**: The frustrations of time, or lack thereof. While I was able to accomplish completing two algorithm challenges today, I unfortunately found it quite difficult to find much free time for much more than that. This I'm certain will be a reoccuring theme during the work week. Fear not, I'm motivated to see this through and more so geeked to see the results. Regardless, after experiencing some difficult trying to solve the *anagram* challenge, I had the opportunity to refactor my solution using both regular expressions and JSON, two tools I'm learning more about with each waking day. 

### Day 5: January 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Unfortunately, today was more busy than yesterday. Regardless, I spent my lunch trying to solve a step algorightm, which is located on [GitHub: jsAlgorithms](https://github.com/HeresJohnny5/jsAlgorithms). While I was able to complete the challenge I found it quite difficult to solve the algorithm without using a multi-nested for loop. I also started my third and final week of MongoDB University's M001: MongoDB Basics. Today I learned about Logical and Array Operators.

**Thoughts**: Today I purchased a NodeJs / MongoDB course on Udemy and plan to spend the better portion of February working through the course material. I hope to not only solidify the foundation which MongoDB University has provided, but get a deeper understanding to both NodeJs and MongoDB. After which I'm really wanting to start learning either AngularJs or React. 

## Day 6: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, no different than yesterday was quite busy, both in and out of work. I however was able to wrap up my third and final week of M001: MongoDB Basics, not to mention take the final exam. While it's not code related I created a Trello Board for the entirety of February. I plan on spending the entire month focusing on NodeJs, MongoDB, and Express.

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot over the past 3 weeks with regards to MongoDB, NoSQL, and querying data. While things are starting to make more sense, I have much to learn. As mentioned above, I created a Trello board and plan to focus the entirety of February on NodeJs, MongoDB, and Express. I purchased a coure on Udemy and have documentation saved and ready to go.

## Day 7: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I took a break from approaching any type of algorithm challenge and focused gaining a deeper understanding of *Asynchronous Code* using the Call Stack, Node API, Callback Queue and Event Loop. 

**Thoughts**: So, the *call stack* is a simple data structure that both recognizes and keeps track of program execution inside the V8 engine, it keeps track of functions currently executing and the statements which are being fired. The first thing that happens is node executes the *main function*, which is the wrapper function that gets wrapped around all other files when said files are being run through Node. I learned that the **call stack can only do one thing at a time**. I learned that any Node API will be both added and removed from the call stack and then placed into the *Node API*, after which said code will be placed into a *call back queue*. There is an *event loop* which looks at the call stack to see when it is empty. Any code nested in the call back queue will not execute until the call stack is completely empty.

## Day 8: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent some time reviewing my [Weather App](https://nameless-bastion-76427.herokuapp.com/index). I also tinkered with the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev). Using certain NPM modules, I made it a point to review supporting documentation in hopes of gaining a deeper understanding to both **request** and **body-parser**.

**Thoughts**: It's always a humbling experience when you look back at your code and realize what you once thought was crystal clear has now become convoluted. After stumbling over my code for a hot minute I decided to turn my attention to another matter which I have difficulty understanding, working with APIs. I spent the rest of my free time tinkering with the *Dark Sky API* and NPM Modules *Request* and *body-parser*.
