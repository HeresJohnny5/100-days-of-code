# 100 Days of Code: Round 1 - John Erickson
### I'm a Software Engineer working for a large enterprise business in the greater Pittsburgh footprint. 

The tech stack I'll be working with in my new role will include:
```javascript
let techStack: string[] = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'SASS', 'Bootstrap', 'JavaScript', 'jQuery', 'TypeScript', 'Angular', 'C#'];
```

## Over the next 100 days I want to:
- Continue to update my portfolio website including new projects which will harness the power of *Angular*, *Node*, *SQL* and *C#*. 
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of intermediate/advanced Vanilla JavaScript features: 
	- *Functional Programming*
	- *Object Oriented Programming*
	- *DOM using Vanilla JavaScript*
	- *Closures*
	- *Asynchronous code*
- Being new to the Angular framework I'm investing a lot of my time w/ online resources to understand the fundamentals and soon move into more intermediate level concepts:
  - Udemy courses: [Angular 7 (formerly Angular 2) - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) by *Maximilian Schwarzmüller*
  - Udemy course: [The Complete Angular Course: Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-angular-master-class/) by *Mosh Hamedani*
- I want to read in full **Clean Code** by *Robert C. Martin*.
