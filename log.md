# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Over the next 100 days I want to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript, I want to better understand Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, and I want to update my portfolio. 

### Day 1: January 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working through some algorithms, I completed challenges including, but not limited to: **reversestring, reverseint, palindrome, maxchar, and fizzbuzz.** I also worked on the 2nd week of MongoDB University's **M001: MongoDB Basics** learning more about *Compass and query operations*.

**Thoughts:** Although working on algorithms can be very frustrating at times, I enjoy the challenge and appreciate being able to complete something with a days work. When working through the algorithms I chose to use ES6 syntax, which forced me to spend some time on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). 

As far as MongoDB is concerned, let's just say I have much to learn. I learned more about querying data using methods **.find, .insertOne(), and .insertMany()**.
