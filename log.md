# 100 Days of Code: Round 1 - John Erickson
### I attempted to complete 100 Days of Code earlier this year however I fell short 64 days in. While I continued my coding journey dabbling in React, Flutter, and Swift post 64 days, I did not commit daily via GitHub nor on social feed via Twitter feed and thus I'm starting anew. 
## Over the next 100 days I want to:
- Create a portfolio website to showcase my web development talent and personal passion projects. 
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of intermediate/advanced Vanilla JavaScript features: 
	- Functional Programming
	- Object Oriented Programming
	- DOM using Vanilla JavaScript
	- Closures
	- Asynchronous code
- I want to invest dedicated time each and every week in code clinics i.e. *Exercism* 
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of CSS
- I want to continue to learn React
- I want to continue to learn mobile app development in iOS gaining a deeper understanding of Xcode and Swift
- I want to continue to learn mobile app development using Google's Flutter SDK

**Today’s Progress**:
I’m currently in the process of making my way through a Udemy course by Angela Yu on [iOS 12 and Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/). Currently I’m 33% complete and while I’ve learned a lot figure it’s a good time to reinforce what I’ve learned and apply it to a real world application; [iOS 12 weather app](https://github.com/HeresJohnny5/portfolioiOSWeatherApp). While there’s several goals I hope to accomplish within the next 100 days I hope to showcase this weather app on my portfolio site which I hope to complete early next year. 

Wanting to gain a deeper understanding to intermediate JavaScript concepts I spent a little over an hour watching a Lynda.com course by Shaun Wassell: [Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Learning-Functional-Programming-JavaScript/585272-2.html). Thus far I’ve learned core concepts of functional programming, what differentiates functional programming and Object-Oriented programming, assigning functions to variables via function expressions, and how you can passing functions as arguments via higher-order functions.
