# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Over the next 100 days I want to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript, I want to better understand Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, and I want to update my portfolio. 

### Day 1: January 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Working through some algorithms, I completed challenges including, but not limited to: **reversestring, reverseint, palindrome, maxchar, and fizzbuzz.** [GitHub: jsAlgorithms](https://github.com/HeresJohnny5/jsAlgorithms).

I also worked on the 2nd week of MongoDB University's **M001: MongoDB Basics** learning more about *Compass and query operations*.

**Thoughts:** Although working on algorithms can be very frustrating at times, I enjoy the challenge and appreciate being able to complete something with a days work. When working through the algorithms I chose to use ES6 syntax, which forced me to spend some time on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). 

As far as MongoDB is concerned, let's just say I have much to learn. I learned more about querying data using methods **.find, .insertOne(), and .insertMany()**.  

### Day 2: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrapped up week 2 of MongoDB University's M001: Introduction to MongoDB Basics. I spent a good chunk of time on MongoDB's documentation reinforcing what I'm learning about Update Operators. 

I also took some time to better understand how an ES6 Array Helper Method, *reduce* can help me solve a **maxchar algorithm**, providing a much better, less convoluted solution.

**Thoughts**: Having access to resources makes it quite easy to ask for premature assistance, however it's extremely important that one learns to struggle before reaching out for help. I spent a good amount of time debugging code using the Google Developer Tools when working through the maxchar algorithm and in doing such I now better understand how to use reduce.

### Day 3: January 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: While I wasn't able to accomplish as much as I'd hope to, I completed yet another algorithm challenge, let alone deploy my weather application. 

**Thoughts**: Using the *slice* method I didn't have much difficulty completing the chunk algorithm challenge, however what I didn't realize is the *slice* method destroys the array which calls the method in the first place. This forced me to do some research and better yet consider alternative options. The more I learn about *reduce* the more I'm falling in love with this amazing Array Helper Method. I also was able to deploy my [Web App](https://nameless-bastion-76427.herokuapp.com/index). 

### Day 4: January 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to complete two algorithm challenges, **anagrams** and **capitalize** using multiple solutions. I also spent some time building a very basic express app, not so much to build, but to better understand the magic behind boilerplate code.

**Thoughts**: The frustrations of time, or lack thereof. While I was able to accomplish completing two algorithm challenges today, I unfortunately found it quite difficult to find much free time for much more than that. This I'm certain will be a reoccuring theme during the work week. Fear not, I'm motivated to see this through and more so geeked to see the results. Regardless, after experiencing some difficult trying to solve the *anagram* challenge, I had the opportunity to refactor my solution using both regular expressions and JSON, two tools I'm learning more about with each waking day. 

### Day 5: January 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Unfortunately, today was more busy than yesterday. Regardless, I spent my lunch trying to solve a step algorightm, which is located on [GitHub: jsAlgorithms](https://github.com/HeresJohnny5/jsAlgorithms). While I was able to complete the challenge I found it quite difficult to solve the algorithm without using a multi-nested for loop. I also started my third and final week of MongoDB University's M001: MongoDB Basics. Today I learned about Logical and Array Operators.

**Thoughts**: Today I purchased a NodeJs / MongoDB course on Udemy and plan to spend the better portion of February working through the course material. I hope to not only solidify the foundation which MongoDB University has provided, but get a deeper understanding to both NodeJs and MongoDB. After which I'm really wanting to start learning either AngularJs or React. 

## Day 6: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, no different than yesterday was quite busy, both in and out of work. I however was able to wrap up my third and final week of M001: MongoDB Basics, not to mention take the final exam. While it's not code related I created a Trello Board for the entirety of February. I plan on spending the entire month focusing on NodeJs, MongoDB, and Express.

**Thoughts**: I learned a lot over the past 3 weeks with regards to MongoDB, NoSQL, and querying data. While things are starting to make more sense, I have much to learn. As mentioned above, I created a Trello board and plan to focus the entirety of February on NodeJs, MongoDB, and Express. I purchased a coure on Udemy and have documentation saved and ready to go.

## Day 7: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I took a break from approaching any type of algorithm challenge and focused gaining a deeper understanding of *Asynchronous Code* using the Call Stack, Node API, Callback Queue and Event Loop. 

**Thoughts**: So, the *call stack* is a simple data structure that both recognizes and keeps track of program execution inside the V8 engine, it keeps track of functions currently executing and the statements which are being fired. The first thing that happens is node executes the *main function*, which is the wrapper function that gets wrapped around all other files when said files are being run through Node. I learned that the **call stack can only do one thing at a time**. I learned that any Node API will be both added and removed from the call stack and then placed into the *Node API*, after which said code will be placed into a *call back queue*. There is an *event loop* which looks at the call stack to see when it is empty. Any code nested in the call back queue will not execute until the call stack is completely empty.

## Day 8: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent some time reviewing my [Weather App](https://nameless-bastion-76427.herokuapp.com/index). I also tinkered with the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev). Using certain NPM modules, I made it a point to review supporting documentation in hopes of gaining a deeper understanding to both **request** and **body-parser**.

**Thoughts**: It's always a humbling experience when you look back at your code and realize what you once thought was crystal clear has now become convoluted. After stumbling over my code for a hot minute I decided to turn my attention to another matter which I have difficulty understanding, working with APIs. I spent the rest of my free time tinkering with the *Dark Sky API* and NPM Modules *Request* and *body-parser*. 

## Day 9: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent some time learning more about ES6 Promises using [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), a promise-based HTTP client. I created a Trello board, setting up a game plan for all of February to gain a deeper understanding to ES6, MongoDB, Express, and NodeJs.

**Thoughts**: While I'm able to read other's code when discussing asynchronous code I stil find it difficult to brainstorm the process when tackeling a problem. I believe, I hope this will get easier with time and practice. I face this same challenge when working with ES6 Promises. Throughout the week I hope to read up on several npm modules I've used recently e.g. request, yargs, axios, let alone ES6 Promises and Array Helper Methods.

## Day 10: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, while short lived was both challenging and rewarding. I spent much of my free time communicating with peers of [The Coding Interview Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/?utm_source=adwords-learn&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=NEW-AW-PROS-TECH-US-DSA-EN-ENG_._ci__._sl_ENG_._vi_TECH_._sd_All_._la_EN_._&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_39357936133_._ad_178076784870_._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-307102297194_._li_9005939_._pd__._&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkvewzO3-2AIVliSBCh0K1A4fEAAYASAAEgKxDfD_BwE), refactoring my code based on peers feedback and learning by others' approach to coding challenges.

**Thoughts**: So I haven't logged back into *The Coding Interview Bootcamp* course for close to a week due to other obligations. While it was nice to take a break from algorithms, it was challenge to look back, let alone understand my code. Thankfully it didn't take nearly as long to grasp my approach and solution. 

The community has been awesome and I've gotten a lot of great feedback. Reviewing others code has provided me the opportunity to look at algorithm challenges in a different light, which I believe will help expand my understanding of JavaScript as a whole.

## Day 11: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent my lunch reinforcing my knowledge of ES6, specifically ES6 Arrow Functions; I forgot how the **this** variable changes based upon scope. I also invested some time learning more about Express and semantic templates e.g. [ejs](http://ejs.co/) and [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

**Thoughts**: While I know I'm not alone, I continue to struggle with time or lack thereof. Regardless, I'm super excited to continue to learn about NodeJs, MongoDB and Express throughout the month of February and more so look forward to starting to learn React come March. 

## Day 12: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: My day started off with receiving a congratulatory email and certificate for completing M001: MongoDB Basics. As mentioned in a previous entry, I learned a lot throughout the 3-week course, but have a lot more to learn. That being said, I registered for a 7-week course, **M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers** staring *March 20th*. I spent my lunch learning about ES6, specifically *Destructuring, Object Literals and Classes*. Unfortunately I didn't have much free time tonight, however I was able to watch several videos from Andrew Mead's [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/?couponCode=LEARNING).

**Thoughts**: It's been a week now since I last used MongoDB. Fearing that I'm going to forget what I learned I purchased [The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/) and plan to start the course late next week. I have all intent to complete the course prior to starting M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers which starts March 20th. Hopefully this will keep my knowledge of MongoDB fresh and more importantly solidfy my knowledge of the database. 

It was really cool learning about **ES6 Destructuring**. I can't say I completely understand the logic, however 

**Example 1**:
```javascript
var demo1 = {
	name: 'john',
	role: 'Learning & Development Specialist'
}

var {name, role} = demo1;

name;
role;
// variables name and role MUST be in the object
```

**Example 2 (Arguments Object)***:
```javascript
var demo1 = {
	name: 'john',
	role: 'Learning & Development Specialist',
}

function greeting({name, role}) {
	return `Hi my name is ${name} and I\'m a ${role}.`;
}

greeting(demo1);
```

**Example 3 (Destructuring with Arrays)**:
```javascript
var animals = ['Kratos', 'Flash', 'Nacho'];

var [boy, ...girls] = animals;

boy;
// this will return 'Kratos'
girls;
// this will return ['Flash', 'Nacho'];
```

---
### Over the next 28 days I want to gain a deeper understanding of both Node.js and MongoDB.

## Day 13: February 1, 2018

**Progress**: So for the month of February I decided to focus 100% of my free time on everything MongoDB related. Today, learned more about NoSQL vocabulary, [document methods](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.0/api/Collection.html) using a test database, [Robomongo](https://robomongo.org/), and [Postman API](https://www.getpostman.com/). 

**Thoughts**: It's much more easy for me to remember NoSQL vocabulary when I compare database terms to JavaScript.
+ Data in NoSQL is formatted in an array like structure similar to data found in JSON. This data is called a **collection**.
+ An individual data record in NoSQL e.g. user is called a **document**.
+ Individual properties in NoSQL e.g. id, name, email, password are called **Field**. In NoSQL, documents in a collection don't need to have the same properties.

While mongo CLI works, Robomongo is a awesome MongoDB GUI which makes working with database data much more visual. 

## Day 14: February 2, 2018

**Progress**: Today I took a deep dive into mongoose reading documentation on [schemas](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html), [models](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html), [validators](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html), etc. I created a dummy app, connected a database, and played around with test data using Robomongo.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to say that things are starting to make more sense, however I fully understand I have a long road ahead of me. This entire weekend I plan on doing nothing more than reading up on the mongoose documentation.  

```javascript
// mongoose model, validator example
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');

var Todo = mongoose.model('Todo', {
	text: {
		type: String,
		required: true,
		minlength: 1, // this will prevent the user from entering a empty string
		trim: true // this will eliminate leading / trailing whitespace
	},
	completed: {
		type: Boolean,
		default: false
	}, 
	completedAt: {
		type: Number,
		default: null
	}
});

var todo = new Todo({text: req.body.text});
	
todo.save().then((doc) => {
	console.log(JSON.stringify(doc, undefined, 2));
}, (err) => {
	console.log(err);
})

```

## Day 15: February 3, 2018

**Progress**: Today I started to learn how to test in MongoDB using the Mocha framework in conjunction with npm modules: expect, and supertest. Using mLab w/ Heroku I was able to successfully launch a test database. I also started to toy around w/ a videogame API: IGDB

**Thoughts**: Going through the 4 month bootcamp with Mined Minds I learned a little about *Test Driven Development* using Ruby. While the syntax is different using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework in conjunction with npm modules [expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) and [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) the logic is similar. 

**Things to do when deploying a database to Heroku**:
+ Setup a real MongoDB database:
```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; // this will be set if the app is running on Heroku or locally 
app.listen(port, () => { 
	console.log(`Server has started on port ${port}.`); 
});
```
+ Tell Heroku how to startup the project and what version of Node is being used:
```javascript
{
  "name": "todo-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server/server.js",
    "test": "mocha server/**/*.test.js",
    "test-watch": "nodemon --exec 'npm test'"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "9.3.0"
  },
  "author": "John Erickson",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.18.2",
    "express": "^4.16.2",
    "lodash": "^4.17.4",
    "mongodb": "^2.2.5",
    "mongoose": "^4.13.9"
  }
}
```
+ Using mLab MongoDB setup a database
+ Commit to GitHub
+ Push to Heroku

I also spent a lot of time working with a videogame API called [IGDB](https://igdb.github.io/api/about/welcome/). I ran into a lot of issues requesting information, however with some patience and help from the community I was able to both successfully make a request and return some information.

## Day 16: February 4, 2018

**Progress**: I wasn't able to code as much as I'd hope to today, however I was able to complete several algorithm challenges. I want to thank one specific Sting method (padEnd) I was not familiar with which helped me solve one specific challenge. 

**Thoughts**: I appreciate the struggle one encounters when faced with a algorithm challenge. Regardless of how ugly the code is, I love the eureka moment one receives when solving said challenge. I also love coming across a unknown JavaScript method which will take your unruly code and make it elegant. So today, I would like to thank the [padEnd()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padEnd) method. The **padEnd()** method pads the current string with a given string (repeated, if needed) so that the resulting string reaches a given length. The padding is applied from the end (right) of the current string.

```javascript
'abc'.padEnd(10);          // "abc       "
'abc'.padEnd(10, "foo");   // "abcfoofoof"
'abc'.padEnd(6, "123456"); // "abc123"
'abc'.padEnd(1);

```

## Day 17: February 5, 2018

**Progress**: I spent the better half of my lunch reading Mongoose documentation, attempting to reinforce my limited knowledge on [Schemas](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) and [Models](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html).

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const userSchema = new Schema({
	name: String
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
// the first argument controls what the collection is called inside the database
// the first argument asks MongoDB if there is a collection called 'User'. If a collection called 'User' is not found, mongoose will create one

```

I also attempted to start learning about Security and Authentication, which led me down a rabbit hole which left me with more questions than answers. 

**Thoughts**: I'm uncertain why, however I feel wrapping my head around certain backend concepts, specifically Schemas and Models is taking more time than I initially expected. It seems with every step forward I'm taking two steps back. This backward momentum especially came across when attempting to learn about Security and Authentication. 

## Day 18: February 6, 2018

**Progress**: Today I continued to dabble with testing using Mocha while saving data in a MongoDB database. I swear one of these days I'll truly understand ES6 Promises, Callbacks and Asynchronous Code. 

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately I was not able to code much today due to several work responsibilities and meetings. I continued to push through [The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/) by Stephen Grider. As mentioned above I'm still struggling with ES6 Promises and Asynchronous Code.

## Day 19: February 7, 2018

**Progress**: So lunch time comes, my laptop is open, I'm primed and ready for an hour of code. One second later a bug I never encountered before causes me to debug for said hour. Problem is the error is still not solved. I decided to take a break and invest some time into Stephen Grider's **The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB**. I reinforced my knowledge of *Schemas*, *Models*, *Model Instances*, *Model Queries*, and *Test Driven Development*. 

**Thoughts**: Encountering the problem I mentioned above was quite frustrating, especially considering the Trello board I created has little to no wiggle room. Lesson of the day, patience is key, don't fear errors and reach out to the community when necessary. Also, it's important to understand that no matter how organized you are, more often than not things will not go as planned and that's OK. 

## Day 20: February 8, 2018

**Progress**: I made progress on **The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB** all while spending time on [MongoDB Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/) and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html).

**Thoughts**: Another fun filled day learning about test driven development, validation, relational data and NoSQL terminology/concepts. Hopefully all this prep work will help me crush my upcoming MongoDB class: Node.js for Developers. 

## Day 21: February 9, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made progress on **The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB**. I learned about the pros/cons of embedded documents vs separate collections. I also learned how to create associations between multiple collections, which I know may sound lame, but let me tell you it's pretty rad!

```javascript
// ***** USER *****
// LIBRARY IMPORT
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// LOCAL IMPORT
const PostSchema = require('./postSchema');

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    validate: {
      validator: (name) => name.length > 2,
      message: 'Name must be longer than 2 characters.'
    },
    required: [true, 'Name is required.']
  },
  blogPosts: [{
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'BlogPost' // this MUST match what's being exported from the BLOGPOST
  }]
});

// MODEL
const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
// the first agument controls what the collection is called inside the database
// the first argument asks MongoDB if there is a collection called 'User'. If a collection called 'User' is not found mongoose will make one

module.exports = User; // User is referenced by the COMMENT

// ***** BLOGPOST *****
// LIBRARY IMPORT
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

// a blog post will have many comments associated with it
const BlogPostSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  content: String,
  comments: [{
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Comment' // The comments variable is an array b/c there can be many comments. This MUST match what's being exported from the COMMENT
  }]
});

const BlogPost = mongoose.model('BlogPost', BlogPostSchema);

module.exports = BlogPost; // BlogPost is referenced by the USER

// ***** COMMENT *****
// LIBRARY IMPORT
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const CommentSchema = new Schema({
	content: String,
	user: {
		type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
		ref: 'User' // this MUST match what's being exported from the USER
	}
});

const Comment = mongoose.model('Comment', CommentSchema);

module.exports = Comment; // Comment is referenced by the BLOGPOST
```

**Thoughts**: While theoretically speaking I understand associations between collections, I think it's going to take some time to both fully understand the concepts taught let alone new syntax applied.

## Day 22: February 10, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made progress on **The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB**. While my day was jam packed w/ errands, I made certain to wake up early to spend more time reinforcing what I started to learn yesterday. On top of that I started to learn about pre/post middlewear and how I can add it to a model's Schema to expand functionality. 

**Thoughts**: Simply put, my head is spinning from backend logic/concepts including, but not limited to, embedded documents, separate collections, Schemas, models, associations, etc...

## Day 23: February 11, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made progress on **The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB**. While I didn't make any significant gains, I spent the majority of the day creating a generic app using JS, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js.  

**Thoughts**: While I've learned a lot over the past 11 days, I can't help think I don't have much to show for it. That got me thinking of creating something very basic, something I could possibly use both in the present and future. Something like a blog app. While I can't help roll my eyes with the idea of taking on even more responsibility, I think writing once a week would do me good, especially considering I'll be starting to learn React come March 1st.

## Day 24: February 12, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made progress on **The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB**. The course went from easily managable to very challenging. Stephen introduced some very sophisticated MongoDB queries which I ran into several issues trying to solve. I also started the last project of the course which introduced the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

**Thoughts**: Today like any other day was faced with struggles, challenges, frustrations, sprinkled with small victories. Although I feel somewhat comfortable with MongoDB, Mongoose I realized quickly that queries can become challenging real quick and that I have a lot left to learn.

## Day 25: February 13, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made progress on **The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB**. While working on a dummy app I had an epiphany, each time I create an app I have a different workflow for creating structure for both my directories and files. After refactoring my code, I created a hierarchy which made my code more modular and clean.

**Thoughts**: While the process of creating an app from scratch is starting to become more familiar, Stephen indirectly created a new file structure which at the time seemed to make little sense; the app separate from the routes, the routes separate from the controllers, the controllers separate from the models, etc. This in combination with functionality being exported, files being imported, and cross-file function invoking can make the head spin. Regardless, I truly believe there's a method to the madness and I'm hoping to incorporate a similiar modular methodology when creating future apps. Below is an example of such setup.

```javascript
// app.js (root directory)
// LIBRARY IMPORT
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')

// LOCAL IMPORT
const routes = require('./routes/routes');

mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/driverAPI');

// MIDDLEWEAR *** THIS MUST GO ABOVE THE ROUTE CALL ***
// assume any incoming requst is JSON and parse it into an object
app.use(bodyParser.json());

routes(app);

module.exports = app;
```

```javascript
// routes.js (routes > routes.js)
// LOCAL IMPORT
const DriversController = require('../controllers/drivers_controller');

module.exports = (app) => {
	// ROUTES
	app.get('/api', DriversController.greeting);
	
	// CREATE DRIVER
	app.post('/api/drivers', DriversController.create);
};
```

```javascript
// driver.js (models > driver.js)
// LIBRARY IMPORT
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const DriverSchema = new Schema({
	email: {
		type: String,
		required: true
	},
	driving: {
		type: Boolean,
		default: false
	}
});

const Driver = mongoose.model('Driver', DriverSchema);

module.exports = Driver;
```

```javascript
// drivers_controller.js (controllers > drivers_controllers.js)
// LOCAL IMPORT
const Driver = require('../models/driver');

module.exports = {
	greeting(req, res) {
		res.send({greeting: 'Hello World!'});
	},
	create(req, res) {
		const driverProps = req.body;
		
		Driver.create(driverProps)
			.then((driver) => res.send(driver));
	}
};
```

## Day 26: February 14, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made progress on **The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB**. Due to Valentines I had limited time to code, however I learned how to separate database functionality between test and development environments using environment variables, dug into Express Middleware and started a Udacity course on Promises.

**Thoughts**: Although I'm still getting used to working with databases I understand the reasoning and importance to separate database functionality from one's test in comparison to development environment. I'm also starting to better understand [Express Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html); example below: 

```javascript
// app.js (root directory)

routes(app);
// MIDDLEWARE
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
	console.log(err);
});

module.exports = app;
```

```javascript
// routes.js (routes > routes.js)

// LOCAL IMPORT
const DriversController = require('../controllers/drivers_controller');

module.exports = (app) => {
	// ROUTES
	app.get('/api', DriversController.greeting);
	
	// CREATE DRIVER
	app.post('/api/drivers', DriversController.create);
};
```

```javascript
// drivers_controller.js (controllers > drivers_controller.js)
// LOCAL IMPORT
const Driver = require('../models/driver');

module.exports = {
	greeting(req, res) {
		res.send({greeting: 'Hello World!'});
	},
	create(req, res, next) {
		const driverProps = req.body;
		
		Driver.create(driverProps)
			.then((driver) => res.send(driver))
			.catch(next); 
			// if something goes wrong with a promise it calls any function that is associated with 'catch'
			// every request handler has access to three arguments: req, res, and next
	}
};

// if a Driver is not created the next function, which will forcibly go to the next middleware handler, which is in app.js. The err argument in the middleware will be equal to the error which was thrown from the previous middleware handler
```

## Day 27: February 15, 2018

**Progress**: Unforutnately due to illness officially taken hold I had a short code day. I did however tinker w/ geo functionality found in Mongoose, dug into ES6 Destructuring and made some ground in Udacity's Promise course.

**Thoughts**: While I didn't make much ground I did come across a great article on JavaScript Promises: [JavaScript Promises: An Introduction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises). I plan on reading this article in full and working through Udacity's Promise course throughout the weekend, that I **Promise**.

## Day 28: February 16, 2018

**Progress**: I spent a little time today working on Node.js and MongoDB. I also started learning about [React](https://reactjs.org/) and started a new React course: [React 16 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Some things I learned about React today:

>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React apps are especially fast because you don't need wait for a server response to get a new page or render something new; React apps do not run on the server side, but in the browser. React apps use components when building user interfaces. Most web pages can be split up into components e.g. header, sidebar, headline, article, etc. This is especially useful because components can be built as self-contained pieces of code. This makes working in teams easier, creates more manageable code and creates reusable components.

**Thoughts**: February is half over, which means I have to split up my time between continuing to learn about Node.js, MongDB and get prepared to start learning React come the 1st of March. I'm really geeked to start learning React, however I need to figure out a smart game plan to continue to learn about intermediate Node.js, MongoDB and Express.

## Day 29: February 17, 2018

**Progress**: I Unfortunately did not get to code as much as I'd hope to today, however during said time I read up on JS Classes on the MDN, read up on ES6 thanks to one [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/blog/) and dug into some @reactjs blogs. 

**Thoughts**: It's funny how I have more time on the weekends due to not working and all, but somehow have less time on the weekends. 

## Day 30: February 18, 2018

**Progress**: Today was my first real day working with React. I made progress in Maximilian's React 16 course learning about React's folder structure, React components and JSX. I created a React application using **create-react-app**.

**Thoughts**: I want to thank **create-react-app** for being AWESOME and providing a quick and painless way to get a React application up and running. 

## Day 31: February 19, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made big progress in Maximilian's React 16 course completing the entirety of Section 3. I learned the pros/cons of class vs functional components, how to output dynamic content using the props object, the pros/cons of state vs non-state, how to handle events with eventHandlers, and how to style both by creating a separate stylesheet and via inline styles. Here's to hoping 10% of this sticks!

**Thoughts**: I'm not certain if it's the best idea to attempt to start learning *React*, considering I'm just coming off attempting to learn *Node.js*, *MongoDB*, and *Express*. I can already see myself mudding up syntax from one framework to the next. I'm going to spend what little time I have tomorrow to look over the React code I wrote thus far, focusing on the **how** rather simply pay attention to the syntax. 

The 1st of March is coming soon and I have to get my schedule together. Staying course, I want to continue to reinforce what I've learned thus far when discussing, *Node.js*, *MongoDB*, and *Express* all while spending the entirety of March going through Maximilian's React 16 course. Oh and I start a 7-week course via MongoDB University the 3rd week of March. Here's to staying busy!

## Day 32: February 20, 2018

**Progress**: Knowing that today would be tight I decided to focus on several key concepts I've learned over the past several weeks. I jumped back into *MongoDB*, *Mongoose* and *TDD* using *Mocha*.  

**Thoughts**: Somewhat off topic, but today I visited my first bike store, Trek Pittsburgh to be specific in hopes of finding my first triathlon bike. Simply put, I'm super excited and I cannot wait to start accumulating some early morning miles. I'm geeked, as stated previously, however I cannot help have anxiety with all that I hope to accomplish and what little free time I have currently.

## Day 33: February 21, 2018

**Progress**: Today like most week days was tight; work, work out, hang out with the wife and burn that midnight oil. I continue to struggle with asynchronous logic using JS Promises. Thank you **Node.js** and **MongoDB** for helping me apply theory to real life application.

**Thoughts**: With 7 days left in February I'm trying to go back through a large portion of *The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB*, not to mention complete the course in full prior to March 1st. Doing such I'll continue my journey to complete some type of project and/or certificate each and every month for the full year of 2018.

## Day 34: February 22, 2018

**Progress**: Today I dug into [Mongoose Validation middleware](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html) testing CRUD logic all while making some progress on *The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB*. 

**Thoughts**: While I have a lot left to learn when discussing anything backend, it's absolutely awesome when things start to click.

## Day 35: February 23, 2018

**Progress**: Today I dug into more advanced Mongo Operators while working on nested subdocuments and virtual types. 

*Nested subdocuments and virtual types example*:
```javascript
// app.js
// IMPORT LIBRARIES 
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// LOCAL IMPORT
const PostSchema = require('./postSchema');

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
	name: {
		type: String,
		validate: {
			validator: (name) => name.length > 2,
			message: 'Name must be longer than 2 characters.'
		},
		required: [true, 'Name is required.'],
		minlength: 1,
		trim: true
	},
	posts: [PostSchema],
	likes: Number
});

UserSchema.virtual('postCount').get(function() {
	return this.posts.length;
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

module.exports = User;

// postSchema.js
// IMPORT LIBRARIES
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const PostSchema = new Schema({
	title: {
		type: String		
	}
});

module.exports = PostSchema;
```
+ virtual types should use ES5 functions rather fat arrow functions so that the **this** variable refers to the model rather the window object.

**Thoughts**: A little over a month ago the statement above would have made absolutely no sense and while I'm far from being fluent in backend logic things are starting to click. I do question the pros/cons of nested subdocuments vs. model properties/methods.

## Day 36: February 24, 2018

**Progress**: Today I spent time working with non-relational associations, passing associations into models and testing associations using populate, a mongoose operator used to reference documents in other collections.

```javascript
// user.js
// LIBRARY IMPORT
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// LOCAL IMPORT
const PostSchema = require('./postSchema');

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
	name: {
		type: String,
		validate: {
			validator: (name) => name.length > 2,
			message: 'Name must be longer than 2 characters.'
		},
		required: [true, 'Name is required.']
	},
	blogPosts: [{
		type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
		ref: 'BlogPost' // this refers to the BlogPost model created in blogPost.js. Not the constant created but the first argument passed into mongoose.model
	}],
	// posts is solely kept to have subdocument documentation
	posts: [PostSchema],
	likes: Number,
});

// VIRTUAL TYPES
// virtual types do not get persisted over to MongoDB databse and as so will not be applied in the model, but outside
// whenever you're thinking about a property on a model that is a derivative or the product of two or more other properties a solution would be to implement a virtual type
// the 'virtual' property tells the Schema i.e. UserSchema that you're creating a virtual type
// virtual properties automatically invoke the function when the property is called
// you want to use a normal function call and not a ES6 fat arrow function because you want 'this' to refer to the UserSchema 
UserSchema.virtual('postCount').get(function() {
	return this.posts.length;
});

// MODEL
const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
// the first agument controls what the collection is called inside the database
// the first argument asks MongoDB if there is a collection called 'User'. If a collection called 'User' is not found mongoose will make one

module.exports = User;

// blogPost.js
// LIBRARY IMPORT
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// LOCAL IMPORT

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

// a blog post will have many comments associated with it
const BlogPostSchema = new Schema({
	title: String,
	content: String,
	// comments is an array b/c the blog may potentially have multiple comments
	// ref value must match what's being exported from comment
	comments: [{
		type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
		ref: 'Comment' // this refers to the Comment model created in comment.js. Not the constant created but the first argument passed into mongoose.model
	}]
});

const BlogPost = mongoose.model('BlogPost', BlogPostSchema);

module.exports = BlogPost;

// comments.js
// LIBRARY IMPORT
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// LOCAL IMPORT

// SCHEMA
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const CommentSchema = new Schema({
	content: String,
	// ref value must match what's being exported from User
	user: {
		type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
		ref: 'User' // this refers to the User model created in user.js. Not the constant created but the first argument passed into mongoose.model 	
	}
});

const Comment = mongoose.model('Comment', CommentSchema);

module.exports = Comment;
```

**Thoughts**: Although I was able to code for several hours today I can't help think it's never enough. Regardless, I feel I made some ground with learning more advanced *Node.js / Mongoose / MongoDB* topics.

## Day 37: February 25, 2018

**Progress**: Unfortunately today was not nearly as productive as I'd hoped; you can't win them all I suppose. I did spend some time reading about middleware on Mongoose docs and setup a schedule to work on advanced mongoose operations/queries; 3 days until I start focusing on React.

**Thoughts**: It's been an amazing month learning about *Node.js, Mongoose, Schemas, models, instances, MongoDB, non-realational database structure, collections, documents, fields, TDD, Promises, asynchronous code, etc.* While I'm geeked to start learning about React I have to figure out some way to find time that I don't have to continue to learn about *Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB*. Luckily I start a MongoDB class come March 20th. Here's to time, or lack thereof.

## Day 38: February 26, 2018

**Progress**: While I made some progress in *The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB* today, I still have 11 more videos to complete before EOD Wednesday 2/28. It shouldn't be a issue, however the section deals with many advanced Mongoose operations and features. 

**Thoughts**: Although I've mentioned this several times before, I'm super happy to have spent the past month plus learning backend logic. That and I'm hoping to find a way to continue to learn and reinforce my understanding of backend logic while I embark on a new journey to learn React. 

## Day 39: February 27, 2018

**Progress**: Today I solved an advanced MongoDB challenge using Mongoose queries in conjunction with MongoDB query selectors. I made progress in The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB (wrap up tomorrow) and had the pleasure of listening to some amazing code podcasts.

**Thoughts**: While I've listened to the [Learn to Code with Me](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/) podcast before, it's been a hot minute since I listened to the podcast or for that matter any code type podcast. During my morning commute I came across a podcast tagline that resonated with me; [**HOW TO LEARN TO CODE WHILE WORKING FULL TIME**](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/learning-to-code-while-working-full-time/). It was great to hear that someone similiar to me learns code during their lunch break. It was insightful to hear that others who struggle with time or lack thereof are learning to code. I made it a point to reach out to both Michael and Laurence to thank them for the content, suggestions, and resources.

## Day 40: February 27, 2018

**Progress**: Well hot dog, 40 days down and February has come and gone. Today I completed The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB and finalized my Trello board for all of March. 

**Thoughts**: I cannot help feel both a sense of anxiety and excitement for my goals starting tomorrow.

*March Goals*:
+ Complete [Academind NodeJS/Express/MongoDB Shopping Cart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3vvxn78MH4&index=2&list=PL55RiY5tL51rajp7Xr_zk-fCFtzdlGKUp)
+ Complete no less than 140 videos of [React 16 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)
+ Start [M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101JS/about) on March 20th
+ Reinforce what I know of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

---
### Over the next 31 days I want to gain a deeper understanding of React.

## Day 41: March 1, 2018

**Progress**: A good start to March if I don't say so myself. Today I completed 15 videos of *React 16 - The Complete Guide*. I learned about React's folder structure, class / functional components, and JSX. I also learned how to create dynamic content using the props object and/or children property. 

**Thoughts**: While I most certainly don't understand how React works, I can already see the opportunity the library and it's component based methodologies present. 

[*Pros*](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/the-good-and-the-bad-of-reactjs-and-react-native/):
+ Virtual DOM in ReactJS makes user experience better and developers work faster
+ ReactJS permits reusing code components, significantly saving time
+ One-direction data flow in ReactJS provides stable code
+ An open-source library

## Day 42: March 2, 2018

**Progress**: Today I learned the pros/cons of stateless vs stateful components, how to pass methods from a class component to functional, how to change state using class methods state and setState using bind. 

**Thoughts**: In hopes of retaining information I decided to create a OneNote and write down notes of what I'm learning while I'm learning.

## Day 43: March 3, 2018

**Progress**: Today I learned about scope using ES6 arrow functions, dynamic content using JSX, conditionals using the ternary operator, and state checks using the render expression. I know it's only been two days, but man oh man does JSX look weird. 

**Thoughts**: While it's great being exposed to so many different things, I can't help question how much of what I'm being exposed to I'm actually retaining. Unfortunately time or lack thereof is always the problem. 

## Day 44: March 4, 2018

**Progress**: Today was split between React and Node.JS. I learned how to update lists efficiently using the key property, reinforced concepts I've learned over the past several days using React documentation and started to work on a fairly basic Node app.

**Thoughts**: While it's great to continue to learn about React it was nice to jump back into Node.JS.

## Day 45: March 5, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made progress in Maximillian's React - 16 course learning a ton regarding styles in React. I learned the pros/cons of inlines styles vs external stylesheets, tinkered with the Radium module, and learned how to configure webpack to implement CSS modules. 

*Inline Styles vs Stylesheets*:
+ Styles applied to any external CSS file are globally scoped
+ Applying inline styles can be beneficial if you want to style something specific, however inline styles do have several disadvantages, one being inline styles cannot harness the full power of CSS e.g. pseudo selectors i.e. hover animations

[npm: radium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/radium) - Radium is a set of tools to manage inline styles on React elements. It gives you powerful styling capabilities without CSS. Using Radium you can harness *pseudo selectors* or *media queries* with *inline styles*.

**CSS Modules**:
When using scoped CSS modules you need to configure the built configuration of your project. The *eject* command grants you access to said configuration. Terminal prompt **npm run eject** will convert your 'everything is managed for me project' into 'everything is managed for me, but I can edit the configuration project'.

When using Git to track application changes, you want to make sure to add / commit all changes before you run npm run eject.

**IMPORTANT**
You cannot return back to the way your application was after running npm run eject

Directories *scripts* and *config* will be created after running npm run eject.

Nested in the config directory are two webpack files. Webpack is the bundling tool which applies all kinds of transformations and optimizations on your files and bundles them together; CSS is part of the files which are bundled and such is the place you can configure your CSS files.

```javascript
// webpack.config.dev.js
// look for test: /\.css$/,
{
	loader: require.resolve('css-loader'),
	options: {
		importLoaders: 1,
		module: true,
		localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]'
	},
}

// ***IMPORTANT** the __ are two underscores, not dashes
```

Copy the following:
```javascript
importLoaders: 1,
module: true,
localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64.5]'
```
And paste into webpack.config.prod.js making sure not to overwrite minimize: true nor sourceMap: shouldUseSourceMap

```javascript
// webpack.config.prod.js
// look for test: /\.css$/,
options: {
	importLoaders: 1,
	module: true,
	localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]',
	minimize: true,
	sourceMap: shouldUseSourceMap,
}
```

**IMPORTANT: You need to restart your development server before changes will be visible.**

Now when you import *'./App.css';* it will now actually scope the CSS classes in App.css to the component where it's imported.

**Thoughts**: The cross between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript AKA JSX continues to blow my mind. I for one cannot wait to wrap my head around this concept/logic. 

## Day 46: March 6, 2018

**Progress**: Today I made progress in Maximillian's React - 16 course; I learned about error handling in React using *React Dev Tools* and [Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html). Today also hit me like a freight train; stupid cold hit hard. 

**Thoughts**: I've remained unscathed both last year and this year, however my time has officially run out. Here's to hoping this cold doesn't overstay its welcome; sleeping on the couch is getting quite old.
