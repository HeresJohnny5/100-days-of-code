# 100 Days of Code: Round 1 - John Erickson
### I'm a Software Engineer working in the greater Pittsburgh footprint where I primarily focus on UI/Frontend responsibilities.  

The tech stack I use in my current role:
```javascript
let workTechStack: string[] = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'SASS', 'Bootstrap', 'JavaScript', 'jQuery', 'TypeScript', 'Angular', 'C#'];
```

## Over the next 100 days I want to:
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of intermediate/advanced Vanilla JavaScript: 
	- *Functional Programming using pure functions*
	- *Object Oriented Programming*
	- *Closures*
	- *Asynchronous JavaScript using several APIs: callbacks, Promises, async/await*
- Working with Angular for the past several months in a production setting has provided me a solid understanding of fundamentals of the framework, however, I have much to learn and thus I'm investing a lot of my free time w/ online resources to understand intermediate-level concepts: 
	- Udemy courses: [Angular 7 (formerly Angular 2) - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) by *Maximilian Schwarzmüller*
	- Udemy course: [The Complete Angular Course: Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-angular-master-class/) by *Mosh Hamedani*	
- Continue to update my portfolio website including new projects which will harness the power of *Advanced CSS/SASS*, *Angular*, *Angular Material*, *React*, *RxJS and/or Redux Patterns*, *Node*, *MongoDB* and *C#*. 
- I want to read in full **Clean Code** by *Robert C. Martin*.
