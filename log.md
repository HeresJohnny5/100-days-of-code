# 100 Days of Code: Round 1 - John Erickson
### I attempted to complete 100 Days of Code earlier this year however I fell short 64 days in. While I continued my coding journey dabbling in React, Flutter, and Swift post 64 days, I did not commit daily via GitHub nor on social feed via Twitter feed and thus I'm starting anew. 
## Over the next 100 days I want to:
- Create a portfolio website to showcase my web development talent and personal passion projects. 
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of intermediate/advanced Vanilla JavaScript features: 
	- Functional Programming
	- Object Oriented Programming
	- DOM using Vanilla JavaScript
	- Closures
	- Asynchronous code
- I want to invest dedicated time each and every week in code clinics i.e. *Exercism* 
- I want to gain a deeper understanding of CSS
- I want to continue to learn React
- I want to continue to learn mobile app development in iOS gaining a deeper understanding of Xcode and Swift
- I want to continue to learn mobile app development using Google's Flutter SDK
